print, "Hello World"
# Use the pound key to make a comment on code in python
# A integer is the thing inside of a variable that we define 
age = 25
print('age')
# okay so that didnt work how i expected it to i thought it was going to print 25
# heres a different version that I think could possibly work
## i didnt try my own version btw I get the f string method from Chat GPT
age = 25
print(f'My age is {age}')
## the f in this string means it is a formatted string it tells pyton to evaluate the expressions inside the curly braces and inset the values into the string
## trying something new with what I just learned
age = 19
print(f'I am {age} years old')
## it didnt work at first because I was not including the f so it wasnt formatting and insetting the value of age into the print string
## it was instead coming back as I am {age} years old

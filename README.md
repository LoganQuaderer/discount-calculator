Discount Calculator
Welcome to my Discount Calculator project! This is the first project I've worked on in Python as a freshman Computer Science student. The goal of this project is to build a simple yet functional calculator that computes the final price of an item after applying a discount. This project has been a great way for me to start learning and practicing Python.

Features
Input: Accepts the original price of an item and the discount percentage from the user.
Calculations:
Calculates the amount of money saved based on the discount percentage.
Computes the final price after applying the discount.
Output: Displays the original price, the discount amount, and the final price after the discount.
Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to achieve the following:

Get familiar with basic Python syntax and operations.
Learn how to interact with users by accepting input.
Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python.
Understand how to structure a simple Python program.
Gain experience with Git and GitHub by managing and sharing my code.
How to Run the Project
To run the discount calculator:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/discount-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd discount-calculator
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python discount_calculator.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the original price and the discount percentage.
Future Enhancements
In the future, I plan to:

Add error handling to manage invalid inputs more effectively.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the calculator more user-friendly.
Expand the project to include more advanced features, such as calculating sales tax.
About Me
I am a freshman Computer Science student, and this is my first Python project. I'm passionate about learning to code and excited to continue developing my skills as I progress through my studies. This project represents the start of my journey in software development.

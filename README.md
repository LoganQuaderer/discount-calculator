# Discount Calculator

Welcome to my **Discount Calculator** project! This is my first project in Python as a freshman Computer Science student. The purpose of this project is to build a simple calculator that computes the final price of an item after applying a discount. This project has been a great way for me to start learning and practicing Python.

## Features

- **User Input:**
  - Accepts the original price of an item.
  - Accepts the discount percentage from the user.
- **Calculations:**
  - Calculates the amount saved based on the discount percentage.
  - Computes the final price after applying the discount.
- **Output:**
  - Displays the original price.
  - Displays the discount amount.
  - Displays the final price after the discount.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aimed to achieve the following:

- Familiarize myself with basic Python syntax and operations.
- Learn how to interact with users by accepting input.
- Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Understand how to structure a simple Python program.
- Gain experience with Git and GitHub by managing and sharing my code.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to:

- Add error handling to manage invalid inputs more effectively.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the calculator more user-friendly.
- Expand the project to include more advanced features, such as calculating sales tax.

## About Me

I am a freshman Computer Science student, and this is my first Python project. I'm passionate about learning to code and excited to continue developing my skills as I progress through my studies. This project represents the start of my journey in software development.

## Feedback and Contributions
